Task 0:
O(1) - Constant
It doesn't matter the size of files, we have no loops.

Task 1:
O(a + b) - Linear
It grows as much as the calls and texts lists are bigger, as we iterate over all items and add phone numbers to the
new sets, which is an O(1) operation.

Task 2:
O(n) - Linear
Just a for loop over all calls and simple operations using a dictionary (O(1))

Task 3:
O(n) - Linear
Iteration over all calls. The bigger the list, longer the processing time.
In the end we sort all codes, cheap operation.

Task 4:
O(a + b): Linear
The bigger the message and call list, longer the processing time as we iterate over both in isolated loops.
