Time Complexity: 
    The time complexity is O(n log (n)) because we are using a Heapsort algorithm. 
    While sorting, I'm checking the index of each element and making calculations for first or second values in the 
    loop which are O(1) operations

Space Complexity:
    Space complexity is O(1) as no new collections are created.
